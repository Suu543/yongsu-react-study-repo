# React

## What is React and why do we need it?

- React is a bunch of JavaScript that someone else wrote that makes it easier to build UI (Front-end web development)

- React modernizes front-end development by:

  - Making the front-end modular via components
  - Components are encapsulated and reusable (they manage themselves)
  - Making it much easier to maintain across teams
  - Simplifying state changes in an application
  - Getting front-end apps to run very, very fast
  - Separates front-end from back-end

## Why did we use an Express Server?
- Express is a Node.js framework that allows us to create a server that can handle HTTP requests
- JSX requires an http
- React development uses a lot of extra tools to make it faster to build

## React in its simplest form
- React - everything we make is a "React" element or component, not a DOM element
- ReactDOM.render - ReactDOM.render takes our React elements and gets them in the DOM (on the page)
- JSX - Allows us to commingle HTML and JS. This saves us from having to wrte tons of JavaScript
- Babel - Compiles JSX to JavaScript
  - Converts our JSX into something the browser can read!

## The basics of JSX & Babel

- We use React to make React Elements
- JSX allows us to write:
```javascript
React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World')
```
- { variable or React element }

## ReactDOM.render and the virtual DOM
- React keeps track of all React elements in a "Virtual DOM" object
- Whenever something changes, React builds a new "Virtual DOM" object and ReactDOM compares them
- Because they are just plain JS objects, it's very fast
- ReactDOM then updates Only the part of the DOM that needs to be changed

## Components Basics
- Components are the backbone of React
- They are little pictures that we can use to build our UI
- They always start with a capital letter
- They Must close
- They look like HTML tags in JSX (but Uppercase), e.g `<Card />`
- They always return some HTML so ReactDOM has something to put on the page
- They can be pure function (simple)
- They can be classes (complex)

## Prop basics
- Components are a lot like JS functions
- They can be rendered as many times as needed
- In order to change what they render, you can send them data you wish (like an argument in a function). We call this data props
- A prop is anything inside a Component call after the component name and looks like an HTML attribute

## Prop Basics continued
- A prop's value comes after the `=`, just like an HTML attribute
- A prop value can be accessed inside the component. It is always an object
- The objects will have a property for each prop that was passed when the component was called
- The value of the property will be the value of that prop

## Components in an array
- React allows us to put components in an array
- JSX can unpack that array
- We typically use `.map()` to build the array of components
- `map()` builds a new array, and expects a return value

## Components as Classes
- Aside from regular JS functions, components can also be made as classes
- The render method returns JSX
- Classes always extend React.Component
- props works the same way in a class but uses this.props (instead of props)
  
## Breaking down components into small parts
- Components can contain other components
- Think of it like the DOM
  - a div lives inside another div
  - A `<City />` lives inside of a `<CitiesContainer>`

## Question
- VirtualDOM will check the previous one and updated one and updates based on the second Virtual DOM as per, my concept is after the updating in Acutal DOM, do react delete the previous VirtualDOM and keep the current VirtualDOM
